## My Personal Portfolio


For a long time, I had a plan to write a Portfolio website that I could add to my Github account. As I have been doing web development-related missions of cybersecurity for a long time, I had unintentionally learned a lot about websites and how to make them better. This was the biggest factor that helped me write this website. Even though I was in summer school, I was able to turn this site into its current state in 1 day. Now I can't wait to establish a blog website linked to this site and share my experiences in my academic life with you.
